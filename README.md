# CollegeCourseSchedule
This application uses a Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF)
front end to display course and professor data. The main 
window for the application contains member variables
for Course Collection and Professor Collection. Those member
variables are loaded with data from a text file that is read in.
The collections are located in a DLL called College Course Libary
That we reference in to handle the text file data.
